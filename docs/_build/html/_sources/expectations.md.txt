## The Right Way, the Wrong Way, and the NDA Way

One of the biggest challenges for me in using the NDA has been coming to terms with what it is, and what it isn't. It's a huge, freely-available system for sharing data from a gigantic number of research studies! This is amazing! At the same time, if you're looking for a system with consistent design and rules for data organization and submission, NDA isn't that.

In the system, the first data submitter of a given data type, or *structure,* decides how that structure looks â€” how variables are named and described, what their data types look like, and so on. There are some unpublished standards about these structures, and future submitters may modify them somewhat. Overall, however, the structures vary wildly from one another. Some structures for questionnaires list single-item responses, some only summary measures. Most structures explicitly reverse-code single-item responses, but some do not. Each questionnaire you might use has its own structure, while every type of medical image shares one structure.

It is what it is. Stressing about it won't help you.
